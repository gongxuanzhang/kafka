/**
 * This class represents the state machine for replicas. It defines the states that a replica can be in, and
 * transitions to move the replica to another legal state. The different states that a replica can be in are -
 * 1. NewReplica        : The controller can create new replicas during partition reassignment. In this state, a
 *                        replica can only get become follower state change request.  Valid previous
 *                        state is NonExistentReplica
 * 2. OnlineReplica     : Once a replica is started and part of the assigned replicas for its partition, it is in this
 *                        state. In this state, it can get either become leader or become follower state change requests.
 *                        Valid previous state are NewReplica, OnlineReplica, OfflineReplica and ReplicaDeletionIneligible
 * 3. OfflineReplica    : If a replica dies, it moves to this state. This happens when the broker hosting the replica
 *                        is down. Valid previous state are NewReplica, OnlineReplica, OfflineReplica and ReplicaDeletionIneligible
 * 4. ReplicaDeletionStarted: If replica deletion starts, it is moved to this state. Valid previous state is OfflineReplica
 * 5. ReplicaDeletionSuccessful: If replica responds with no error code in response to a delete replica request, it is
 *                        moved to this state. Valid previous state is ReplicaDeletionStarted
 * 6. ReplicaDeletionIneligible: If replica deletion fails, it is moved to this state. Valid previous states are
 *                        ReplicaDeletionStarted and OfflineReplica
 * 7. NonExistentReplica: If a replica is deleted successfully, it is moved to this state. Valid previous state is
 *                        ReplicaDeletionSuccessful
